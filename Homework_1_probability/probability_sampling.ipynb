These are all fancy versions of a coin toss (returns T/F with 50% probability each), a roll of the dice (returns 1..6 with equal probability).\n","\n","ALL of these \"simulate probability\" routines can be implemented using JUST numpy's uniform number generator  (generates a number between 0 and 1 with all values equally likely). The simplest way to think of all of these methods is that you chop up the unit interval 0..1 into the number of possible outcomes, with each bit of the unit interval representing how likely that event is. Then you just generate a number from 0 to 1 and see which bin you fell into.\n","\n","For continuous probability functions, you use uniform twice - once to pick the x value, once to pick the y value. We will not do this here.\n","\n","Why the functions are set up they way they are: You need to input how likely each discrete event is. There's three basic methods for specifying this.\n","1) List each discrete event and how likely it is\n","2) All events are equally likely, just say how many there are (bins) and the mapping between the bins and the 'labels'.Usually the bins represent some spatial variable like location or angle, but could be movement\n","3) There is a function that represents how likely each event is, with the x coordinate representing some continuous variable like distance (think Gaussian error for movement)\n","\n","For each method that you'll implement the above information is passed in using a dictionary. I'm using a dictionary (instead of a class) because it's a bit easier to understand/implement, but the 'right' way to do this is as a class (see the last, optional, problem)."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Requirement already satisfied: numpy in c:\\users\\osian\\anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages (1.26.4)\n","Requirement already satisfied: matplotlib in c:\\users\\osian\\anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages (3.9.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: contourpy>=1.0.1 in c:\\users\\osian\\anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages (from matplotlib) (1.2.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: cycler>=0.10 in c:\\users\\osian\\anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages (from matplotlib) (0.11.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: fonttools>=4.22.0 in c:\\users\\osian\\anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages (from matplotlib) (4.51.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: kiwisolver>=1.3.1 in c:\\users\\osian\\anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages (from matplotlib) (1.4.4)\n","Requirement already satisfied: numpy>=1.23 in c:\\users\\osian\\anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages (from matplotlib) (1.26.4)\n","Requirement already satisfied: packaging>=20.0 in c:\\users\\osian\\anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages (from matplotlib) (23.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: pillow>=8 in c:\\users\\osian\\anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages (from matplotlib) (10.3.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: pyparsing>=2.3.1 in c:\\users\\osian\\anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages (from matplotlib) (3.0.9)\n","Requirement already satisfied: python-dateutil>=2.7 in c:\\users\\osian\\anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages (from matplotlib) (2.9.0.post0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: six>=1.5 in c:\\users\\osian\\anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages (from python-dateutil>=2.7->matplotlib) (1.16.0)\n"]}],"source":["# Install a pip package in the current Jupyter kernel\n","# Note: this is a safety check in case your JN install was not in the same place as your libraries\n","import sys\n","!{sys.executable} -m pip install numpy\n","!{sys.executable} -m pip install matplotlib"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# The imports you'll need\n","from numpy import random\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"deletable":false,"editable":false},"source":["## Boolean\n","Simplest case - returns True or False, with some probability\n","\n","Since probability of returning False is 1-prob(True), only need to specify one value in info_variable info_variable[\"prob_return_true\"] has the probability of returning True"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["def sample_boolean_variable(info_variable):\n","    \"\"\" Generate one sample from a boolean variable\n","    @param info_variable contains the probability of the sensor returning True\n","    @returns True or False \"\"\"\n","\n","    # Probabilities have to be between 0 and 1...\n","    if info_variable[\"prob_return_true\"] < 0.0 or info_variable[\"prob_return_true\"] > 1.0:\n","        ValueError(f\"Value {info_variable['prob_return_true']} not between zero and one\")\n","\n","    # First, use random.uniform to generate a number between 0 and one.

It would be very expensive to do this every time you asked for a sample, like you did in the discrete problem.\n","\n","This is also a good time to do some fancy numpy array stuff, namely, using \"where\" to find the index (instead of writing your own for loop)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":25,"metadata":{"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["class SampleProbabilityMassFunction:\n","    def __init__(self, in_pdf, x_range=(0.0, 1.0), n_bins=100):\n","        \"\"\" Given a probability mass function, what range of x to use, and the number of samples, create the running\n","        sum/data needed to generate random samples from that pmf\n","        @param in_pdf - the function representing the probability distribution\n","        @param x_range - min and max x values as a tuple\n","        @param n_bins - number of bins \"\"\"\n","\n","        # TODONE - Initialize correctly\n","        #  Where the bins start and end\n","        #  The amount of probability to put in each bin\n","        #  The running sum\n","\n","        #First, precalculate the center of each bin:\n","        #initialize the array\n","        self.bin_centers = np.zeros(n_bins)\n","        #calculate the bin size from the range and number of bins\n","        self.bin_size = (x_range[1] - x_range[0])/n_bins\n","        #Enter the location of each pin center\n","        for i in range(0,len(self.bin_centers)):\n","            self.bin_centers[i] = x_range[0] + self.bin_size*(i+0.5)\n","            \n","        \n","        # Create the pmf by evaluating in_pdf at the center of each bin\n","        #   Don't forget to normalize - the sum of self.bin_heights should be 1\n","        self.bin_heights = in_pdf(self.bin_centers)/sum(in_pdf(self.bin_centers))\n","        \n","        # Running sum of probabilities - bin_sum[i] = sum(bin_heights[0:i])\n","        #  Note: It's a bit easier to generate_sample if you make this array n_bins+1, with the first value being 0\n","        #   and the last value being 1\n","\n","        #Initialize the running sum array\n","        self.bin_sum = np.zeros(n_bins+1)\n","\n","        #Each entry in the running bin sum is the previous sum + the current probablility\n","        for i in range(1,len(self.bin_sum)):\n","            self.bin_sum[i] = self.bin_sum[i-1] + self.bin_heights[i-1]\n","\n","    def generate_sample(self):\n","        \"\"\" Draw one sample from the pmf\n","        Very similar to the discrete example above, for picking which bin, except you've pre-calculated the running sum.\n","        Very similar to bin_sample for returning the bin center, exept you've pre-calculated the bin centers\n","        @return bin center \"\"\"\n","        zero_to_one = random.uniform()\n","\n","        # You want the i where bin_sum[i] <= zero_to_one < bin_sum[i+1]\n","        # Fancy version: Use np.where\n","\n","        #Use np.where to find all the values where bin_sum is greater than the random value\n","        #get the largest index bin_sum from this list, subtract one to offset for the 0th entry in bin_sum\n","        #Return the bin center\n","        return self.bin_centers[np.max(np.where(zero_to_one >= self.bin_sum))]\n","\n","\n","    def _generate_counts(self, n_samples):\n","        \"\"\" Generate n samples\n","        @param n_samples - number of samples\n","        @returns a numpy array with the counts for each bin, normalized\"\"\"\n","\n","        # Counts\n","        counts = np.zeros(self.bin_centers.shape[0])\n","\n","        # Make sure to take enough samples for all of the bins...\n","        bin_width = self.bin_centers[1] - self.bin_centers[0]\n","        for _ in range(0, self.bin_centers.shape[0] * 100):\n","            x_value = self.generate_sample()\n","            bin_index = np.ceil((x_value - self.bin_centers[0]) / bin_width)\n","            counts[int(bin_index)] += 1.0\n","\n","        # Normalize\n","        counts = counts / sum(counts)\n","        return counts\n","\n","    def test_self(self, in_pdf):\n","        \"\"\" Check/test function\n","        @param in_pdf - the pdf function used to generate the values\n","        @returns True/False\"\"\"\n","\n","        # Expected probability values\n","        expected_probs = in_pdf(self.bin_centers)\n","        # Normalize\n","        expected_probs /= np.sum(expected_probs)\n","\n","        counts = self._generate_counts(100 * self.bin_centers.shape[0])\n","\n","        for exp, c in zip(expected_probs, counts):\n","            print(f\"pmf perc {c} expected {exp}\")\n","\n","            if np.abs(exp - c) > 0.1:\n","                print(\"Failed\")\n","                return False\n","\n","        print(\"Passed\")\n","        return True\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":26,"metadata":{"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["def pdf(x):\n","    \"\"\" Made-up pdf (a quadratic).
